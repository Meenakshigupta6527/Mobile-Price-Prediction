# Mobile-Price-Prediction
Feature Extraction and Price Prediction for Mobile Phones

# Overview Of the project 
In this project, we will work with a dataset that contains detailed information about various mobile phones, including their model, color, memory, RAM, battery capacity, rear camera specifications, front camera specifications, presence of AI lens, mobile height, processor, and, most importantly, the price. our primary goal is to develop a predictive model for mobile phone prices.

# Steps I followed for this Mobile Prize Prediction 
Data Exploration
Data Cleaning
Data Preprocessing
Feature Extraction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Feature Scaling
Model Building
Model Evaluation



# Conclusion
This conclusion can be used to predict the price of a mobile phone based on its memory capacity and RAM. For example, if a new mobile phone with 512GB of memory is released, its price can be predicted to be higher than 25000.
